            </div>
            <div class="data">
                The automobile industry consists of a wide range of companies and organizations involved in the
                designing and developing, of motor vehicles. It is considered as one of the world 's most important
                economic sectors in terms of revenue.The word automotive comes from the Greek autos (self), and Latin
                motivus (of motion), referring to any form of self-powered vehicle.[clarification needed] This term, as
                proposed by Elmer Sperry (1860-1930), first came into use with reference to
                automobiles in 1898.

            <div class="data">
                India’s automotive industry is one of the successful cases of India’s economic
                liberalization strategy set into motion since 1991. The industry which was dominated
                by a few domestic manufacturers was hardly known for any innovations before 1991,
                but is now one of the fastest growing manufacturing industries not just in India but
                globally as well. In 2010, India has emerged as the second fastest growing car market
                in the world next only to China. Sales of two wheelers crossed 10 million units during
                the year, a first, with all major two-wheeler manufacturers registering high double digit
                growth. India in 2010 is the largest tractor manufacturer, second largest two-wheeler
                manufacturer, fifth largest commercial vehicle manufacturer and the eleventh largest car
                manufacturer in the world.

                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="data">
                The automotive industry began in the 1860s with hundreds of manufacturers that pioneered the horseless
                carriage. For many decades, the United States led the world in total automobile production. In 1929,
                before the Great Depression, the world had 32,028,500 automobiles in use, and the U.S. automobile
                industry produced over 90% of them. At that time, the U.S. had one car per 4.87 persons.[5] After 1945,
                the U.S. produced about 75 percent of world's auto production. In 1980, the U.S. was overtaken by Japan
                and then became world leader again in 1994. In 2006, Japan narrowly passed the U.S. in production and
                held this rank until 2009, when China took the top spot with 13.8 million units. With 19.3 million units
                manufactured in 2012, China almost doubled the U.S. production of 10.3 million units, while Japan was in
                third place with 9.9 million units.[6] From 1970 (140 models) over 1998 (260 models) to 2012 (684
                models), the number of automobile models in the U.S. has grown exponentially.

                <h1>ROLE OF DATA</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="data">
                Automotive industry players must invest in data management to protect and grow their relationships with
                customers. Automakers and dealers must “look under the hood”—gathering not only sales and service
                information but data garnered from loyalty apps, social media platforms, and even vehicles themselves—to
                understand and predict their customers’ buying decisions and evolving transportation needs.
            </div>
            <div class="data">
                Being aware of market demand and making data-driven decisions is paramount for any business strategy and
                management. Leveraging the information available within the organization, combined with market
                knowledge, help organisations work smarter and reduce costs while providing agility and capability. As
                market knowledge is built upon trends and competition research, using information available company-wide
                is the key to a better management of internal resources.

                Today, the automotive manufacturers are managing an increasingly wide range of metrics that now cover
                every aspect of their industry, from manufacturing to sales and road performance. For players in the
                industry, having relevant insights regarding prices and stocks is a key aspect for increasing efficiency
                and, consequently, revenue.

                <h1>DATA ANALYSIS OF AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="data">
                <h3>Analysis of the data is essential, and it requires a rigorous process consisting of various steps:
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Understanding the data:</h4> Acquiring, unifying, and gaining insight from data is
                        key to
                        responding to the challenges and it is the first and foremost step to be taken while analysing
                        the data.
                        It involves understanding the raw data which further involves analyzing what are the neccessary
                        columns
                        and which are not for the futher processing of the data.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Cleaning the data:</h4>Once data is collected from all the necessary sources, your
                        data team
                        will be tasked with cleaning and sorting through it. Data cleaning is extremely important
                        during the data analysis process, simply because not all data is good data.

                        Data scientists must identify and purge duplicate data, anomalous data, and other
                        inconsistencies that could skew the analysis to generate accurate results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Analysing the data:</h4>Data that is processed, organized and cleaned would be ready
                        for the analysis. Various data analysis techniques are available to understand, interpret, and
                        derive conclusions based on the requirements. Data Visualization may also be used to examine the
                        data in graphical format, to obtain additional insight regarding the messages within the data.

                        Statistical Data Models such as Correlation, Regression Analysis can be used to identify the
                        relations among the data variables. These models that are descriptive of the data are helpful in
                        simplifying analysis and communicate results.
                        <ul style="list-style-type:square">
                            <li>
                                <h4>Exploratory data analysis:</h4> data analysis is used to understand the
                                messages within a dataset. This technique involves many iterative processes to
                                ensure that the cleaned data is further sorted to better understand the useful
                                meaning. Data visualization techniques such as analyzing data in an Excel sheet or
                                other graphical format and descriptive analysis techniques such as calculating the
                                mean or median are examples of exploratory data analysis.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Interpreting the results:</h4>The final step involves interpreting the results obtained from
                        the analysis of data by various visualization techniques such as tables and charts, which help
                        in communicating the message clearly and efficiently to
                        the users. The analysis tools provide facility to highlight the required information with color
                        codes and formatting in tables and charts.
